      <!-- The services that needs to be started earlier in the boot sequence and in particular order.
         Every item in this array contains a flatten component name of a service that needs to be
         started and a list of parameters after hashtag symbol. Here's the format:

         <item>com.bar.foo/.Service#bind={bind|start|startForeground},user={all|system|foreground},
         trigger={asap,userUnlocked}</item>

         bind: bind - start service with Context#bindService
               start - start service with Context#startService
               startForeground - start service with Context#startForegroundService
               If service was bound it will be restarted unless it is constantly crashing.
               The default value is 'start'
         user: all - the service will be bound/started for system and all foreground users
               system - the service will be started/bound only for system user (u0)
               foreground - the service will be bound/started only for foreground users
               The default value is 'all'
         trigger: indicates when the service needs to be started/bound
               asap - the service might be bound when user is not fully loaded, be careful with
                      this value, the service also needs to have directBootAware flag set to true
               userUnlocked - start service when user unlocked the device
               The default value is 'userUnlocked'

         If the service bound/started for foreground user it will be unbound/stopped when user
         is no longer foreground.
